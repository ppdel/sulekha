    <h1>Our Priorities</h1>
    <p>The company has set research and development priorities in germplasm maintenance, resistance management, seed
      improvement, and soil health & ecology. These priority aspects significantly impact agriculture development in
      Nepal, and thus, by focusing on these areas, the company aims to contribute to increased crop yields, improved
      food security, and sustainable farming practices.
    </p>
    <h2>Germplasm Collection and Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Nepal is rich in indigenous wild and landrace plant genetic resources. Germplasm collection is crucial for
      preserving this biodiversity and ensuring food security. By collecting and conserving diverse plant genetic
      materials, the company supports development of crops that are better adapted to local conditions, more resistant
      to pests and diseases, and more nutritious.
    </p>
    <h2>Seed Improvement</h2>
    <p>By including seed management as a priority, research can ensure the availability of high-quality seeds, which
      is essential for improving crop yields and food security. Similarly, seed management practices contribute to
      sustainable agriculture by promoting the use of seeds that require fewer resources and are more environmentally
      friendly. This helps in maintaining soil health and reducing the ecological footprint of farming. This also helps preserve
      genetic diversity, which is essential for breeding programs and adapting to changing environmental conditions.
      This diversity is crucial for developing new varieties that can withstand climate change and other stresses.
    </p>
    <h2>Soil Health and Ecology</h2>
    <p>Understanding soil ecology is essential for sustainable agriculture. Soil health directly affects crop
      productivity, water retention, and nutrient availability. Research in soil ecology can help identify practices
      that enhance soil fertility, reduce erosion, improve water management, and understand soil microbial interactions.
      The company will conduct research in these areas and enhance practices and enhance knowledge in soil ecology which
      leads to more sustainable farming practices that benefit both farmers and the environment.</p>
