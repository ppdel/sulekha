      <h2>Main Crops Grown in Nepal </h2>
      <p>The main crops that are grown in Nepal are rice, corn, wheat and millet<sup>1</sup>. These are all staples to
        life in
        Nepal. Rice is an irreplaceable element to Nepali cuisine, where it features in a lot of Nepali foods due to its
        ease of access and its adaptability to any dish. Rice is something that many Nepali people are very thankful
        for, due to the fact that it contributes to almost 50% of all cereal based calorie intakes<sup>2</sup> for many
        people,
        where it is regularly consumed at least once or twice a day.</p>
      <h2>Agriculture to Nepali people.</h2>
      <p>For many in Nepal, agriculture is a lifestyle. About 70% of the population lives on subsistence farms, where
        they cultivate just enough for themselves and their families. Most of the subsistence farmers and farms rely on
        old-fashioned farming (without modern equipment) due to unavailability of proper equipment, such as
        tractors.<sup>3</sup>
        This creates a heavy reliance on one’s self to carry out all the hard manual labour work, including plowing,
        fertilizing, etc. Also, due to the lack of insecticides and pesticides being used to protect one’s plants there
        is a risk of crops being damaged and thrown away, which can make a big difference for a poor farmer in Nepal.
      </p>
      <h2>Who is reliant on agriculture?</h2>
      <p>To Nepali people, agriculture is a subsistence practice. People cultivate only to provide for themselves and
        their close ones. Only about 10%<sup>4</sup> of farmers actually sell their produce for a living. Most people
        who are
        reliant on farming did not get the opportunity to go to school and get educated, because of things like poverty,
        affecting about two-fifths of the population<sup>5</sup>. This caused those who are educated to migrate out of
        the country
        for foreign jobs, where they can make more money and have further opportunities for improving their quality of
        life.</p>
